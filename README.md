# reinforcement-learning-ai-learns-snake
This project involves developing and training an AI agent that learns to play snake using reinforcement learning.\
The agent learns from the environment and trains based on rewards and penalties. \
This project utilises PyTorch to create the neural network to train the AI agent.
